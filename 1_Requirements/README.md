# Introduction 
Our system puts forward an automatic and precise door opening system based on human movement sensing near the door. Well opening a door in places like hotels, Shopping complexes, and offices can be a tedious task and sometimes requires hiring a person just for the sake of opening door whenever a person arrives.
# Research
Well this project proposes a system that allows for automatic door opening solution by sensing human presence near it. Our system achieves this functionality with the help of PIR sensors. PIR stands for passive infrared sensors. Every live body emits some infrared energy. This energy is sensed by a PIR sensor from a good distance. This signal is then processed and door is opened and closed based on this data.

## What
When a living being arrives within the sensor range, it detects its presence and sends out a command that opens the door. The door then automatically closes after a specific time delay if there is no further motion near the door.
## Who
Opening a door in places like hotels, Shopping complexes, and offices can be a tedious task and sometimes requires hiring a person just for the sake of opening door whenever a person arrives. So, this can be used there to overcome these problems. 
## Why
Automatic doors effectively contribute to energy saving and reduce annual heating and cooling costs. Doors open only when activated and automatically close so to eliminate the doors being left open. They also prevent air-conditioning from escaping and outside air and dust from entering.
## When
Opening a door in places like hotels, Shopping complexes, and offices, whenever a person arrives.
## How
Automatic doors require a sensor that detects when the door needs to open. When the sensor detects a cue, it then sends a signal to the door operating mechanism. After receiving that signal, the mechanism opens the door.

# SWOT Analysis 
## Strength
Automatic doors effectively contribute to energy saving and reduce annual heating and cooling costs. Doors open only when activated and automatically close so to eliminate the doors being left open. They also prevent air-conditioning from escaping and outside air and dust from entering.
## Weakness
The installation process of automatic doors mandates the need of a professional technician.They also require regular maintenance and check-ups to guarantee proper functioning which also can be expensive. This means that the expenses do not end upon installation. If repairs are required, replacement parts can be costly. 
## Opportunities 
The system can be later enhanced by integrating counter mechanism so as to keep track of the number of persons inside the facility.

## High Level Requirements
- Accuracy in Temperature detection
- Essential components include atmega328 micro controller, sensor
